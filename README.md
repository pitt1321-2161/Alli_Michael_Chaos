# Alli_Michael_Chaos
We're going to examine several examples of chaos and plot some beautiful examples thereof.

In particular, we currently intend to examine several of the chaotic behaviors of the swinging atwood machine.  This will involve first finding the requisite coupled differential equations, most likely with the use of the Lagrangian.  Having achieved a simulation of this system, and having explored its limiting cases, we will then attempt to use the concept of fractal dimensions to perform further analysis on our system.

As we set a timeline for the completion of this project, we will probably attempt to work with a three week schedule-- wherein the first week will involve getting the differential equations and getting the simulation of the swinging atwood machine, the second week will involve exploring our system with the use of fractal dimensions, and the third week will involve writing up our results/obtaining the best possible figures.  Of course we will maintain some level of flexibility when working with this schedule, and we would like to stay open to the possibility of further tangents.
