# Alli_Michael_Chaos
We're going to examine several examples of chaos and plot some beautiful examples thereof.

Project Proposal:

The goal of this project is to examine and investigate chaos created from a swinging atwood machine. We will have to create the data from analyzing the mechanics of the machine. This will require understanding how the atwood machine works and developing a system of differential equations to create the motion for different intitial conditions. We will create several plots. One, of the motion itself, one of the chaos diagram, and one of the fractals produced from the machine. Also, we will analyze the fractal dimension of the patterns traced out.
